"""
Problem:
Count the frequency of each word in a given text.

Example:
Input: "apple banana apple orange banana apple"
Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}

Approach:
- Split the text into words using split().
- Create an empty dictionary.
- For each word, count how many times it appears.
- Save the word and its count into the dictionary.

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) because count() function inside loop is O(n).

Space Complexity:
O(n) for storing counts of n unique words.
